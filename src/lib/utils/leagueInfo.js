      "bio": "As the 2024 dynasty fantasy football season looms, Team A.J. finds itself in a precarious position despite its moderately successful 17-9 record from last year.\n Unfortunately, that success seems more like a distant memory as they head into the new season ranked dead last in both redraft and dynasty value. The team's glaring weaknesses begin at the quarterback position, with Geno Smith QB23, Will Levis QB24, and Justin Fields QB32 forming the worst projected QB group in the league. Their running back situation is equally dire, headlined by Zamir White RB23 and Ty Chandler RB49, the latter of whom is an unreliable starter. Even their tight ends leave much to be desired. Despite acquiring Garrett Wilson WR7 and Mark Andrews TE4 in a blockbuster trade, the decision to part ways with key assets like Justin Fields, Diontae Johnson, and Travis Kelce has left the team devoid of depth. At an average age of 26.7 per starter, Team A.J. should be in a prime position to contend, but they are far from it.\nWith three first-round draft picks over the next two years and a recent selection of Michael Penix Jr., there's a glimmer of hope for the future. However, with a roster that's more fragile than formidable and crucial positions significantly underperforming, Team A.J. is in for a tumultuous 2024 season.",
